Took inspiration from the popular 2022 anime Blue Lock to work on a project that was based around soccer. 
I used Python to perform a hypothesis test to determine the p-value of whether to reject or fail to reject 
the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's using a 10% significance level. 

Tools Used:
- Pandas
- MatPlotlib
- Pingouin
- scipy
